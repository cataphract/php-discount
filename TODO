- Add callback for tags, like code so one can add syntax highlight support for code section without having to reparse the generated doc
- Implement the full test suite
- Use xmlwriter to avoid to have to tidy the output
- Support for stream as output or input (in fromFile, toFile)
- Remove everything we don't use in discount
- Play with re2c, could be faster/cleaner, as a 2nd backend
